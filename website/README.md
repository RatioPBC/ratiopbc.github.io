# website

## Getting Started

Once you bootstrap and enter your project, fetch your dependencies and start the build server. The server is available at http://localhost:4999

```shell
cd website
mix deps.get

mix tableau.server
```

## Production Builds

To build for production, run the `mix build` alias to build your site and compile any assets (depends on what asset you chose when generating your site).

Running your build with `MIX_ENV=prod` is important so that the live reload JS script is not loaded, and also allows you to configure your app differently in dev vs prod, like showing future posts in dev, but not in prod.

```shell
MIX_ENV=prod mix build
```
